        "text": "I am a sound designer and electroacoustic music composer working with sound as a plastic and malleable material. After studying sound engineering and fine arts, nowadays my practice spans light installations, original soundtracks, sound design workshops, and live performance contexts. My music explores friction by organizing and disturbing sound simultaneously, collapsing rhythms into dense textures. Influenced by jazz, club and rave music, as well as acousmatic and electroacoustic traditions, I approach composition as a space where rhythm, texture, and instability coexist. Inspired by François Bayle’s i-son concept, I focus on sound as a vector of mental images, shaping sonic forms that evoke spatial and perceptual experiences."
